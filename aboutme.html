	<H1>About Me</H1>
	
	<p> There's not too much to tell about myself, I was born and raised in Maine, and
	now I'm back here for college. I took my first semester of school at Mississippi State
	University. This was a great experience to live somewhere other than the Northeast
	and see how the culture in different parts of America were.
	</p>

	<p> I went to Mississippi State because I had the chance to try out for the football
	team, but unfortunately, the school was too far away for me and I decided to come back
	before my opportunity.
	</p>
	
	<H2>Hobbies</H2>
	
	<p> My favorite hobby is like a lot of typical Mainers, but I like to fish. In the 
	Summer fishing takes up most of my free time. I mostly fish for bass, but I also like
	fishing for trout and would like to try ocean casting.
	</p>

	<p> As another hobby, I like to travel different places in the world. So far I have 
	been to a bunch of different places in Canada. I have also been to Hungary and Sweden in
	Europe also. My goal is to visit most of the countries in Europe.
	</p>
	
	<H2>Clubs/Organizations</H2>
	
	<p> My first semester of college at Mississippi State University I joined the club
	hockey team that was there. It was a very good experience and I met a lot of people
	through this.
	</p>
	
	<p> At the University of Maine I have not joined any clubs yet, but I have become a
	pledge at Theta Chi Fraternity Gamma Chapter. This has been a great way for me to
	meet new people around campus and to get some good advice for my classes from the 
	upperclassmen in the fraternity.
